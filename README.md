# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

- practiced fetching data from the json file
- the CSS attr() function
- chart.js JavaScript library for HTML-based charts, although I didn't end up using it in the final version
- canvas element practice
- the importance of removing default margins - doing this first would have saved a great deal of time

### Continued development

Working on better initial structuring and use of css classes instead of overly specific hard-coding the styles for individual elements. I still have much to do!
